        text="One of the most iconic views in Luzon, Mt. Tall boasts a volcano inside a lake inside an island. If you fancy  a closer look, the hike up to the crater is a mere 45 minutes, and is easy enough for beginners. Guides will assist you most of the way, and you'll see the peculiar environment found on an active volcano, including volcanic rocks and stream vents. The hike can be dusty and hot, so plan for an early morning trip, and then unwind with somee bufalo before going back home!"

It has an onomatopoeic feeling â€“ that of suspense and grandness. Maybe it describes the grandeur of the range and the abrupt rolling of its slopes.Actually a small mountain range, Mt. Daguldul has several gems to offer."
